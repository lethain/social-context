To all the content creators beholden to a platform: "If you plan to write across decades, you simply must own the interfaces to your content. You should absolutely delve into other platforms as they come and go, [...] but they’ll never be a durable home." https://t.co/EDlFyUPTZw

As folks think about the future of Twitter today, it’s a good reminder of all the amazing communities that were thriving when Twitter was founded in ‘06 but gone in ‘22, and why it’s so important to own both your content and the DNS record it’s hosted at
