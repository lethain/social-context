Such an amazing post by @Lethain on how Uber built its SRE organization. Proud to have been part of that experience, and working alongside many of the fine folks. And agree with the ending sentiment. https://t.co/fhNrtJAtuR

@jhscott @johncutlefish Great posts‚Äîdo you know of any similar posts not for SRE/product but for SWE/dev? @Lethain has a good chapter on general systems thinking (https://t.co/8RatbpxDKg), but I haven't come across any attempts at seriously modeling dev processes.
