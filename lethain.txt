To all the content creators beholden to a platform: "If you plan to write across decades, you simply must own the interfaces to your content. You should absolutely delve into other platforms as they come and go, [...] but they’ll never be a durable home." https://t.co/EDlFyUPTZw

As Alan Jacobs put it years ago: own your turf. That goes for any kind of writer who wants to write for more than a few years’ eyeballs: https://t.co/GeyXZXdmjk
