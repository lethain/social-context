@FrancisShanahan @Cutlerish Same, tbqh. 

But seriously, these seem similar to the staff Eng archetypes from @Lethain ‘s book &amp; guide on https://t.co/MzanN5VhIE but ever so slightly different https://t.co/rAebuF1M2B

@anamauad @Lethain 3/4 This book mentions the Staff archetypes.
Archetype term helps label these frequent variants of Staff-plus engineers.
Where there is a tech-lead as archetypes, but not as a rule:

Yes, Staff-plus will have different skills from others.

@mknepprath You should join my book club and read https://t.co/r90atzvS8w!

It has a section about “how to get to staff engineer” which is not as relevant, but still interesting to learn about how different orgs do things.

and it's been a struggle figuring out how to communicate what I'm /actually/ looking for, but today I remembered that there's a book about what staff engineering actually /is/ https://t.co/z3VtqizSoK and that I can point to archetypes
