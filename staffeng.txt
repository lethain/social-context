It has a section about “how to get to staff engineer” which is not as relevant, but still interesting to learn about how different orgs do things.

This book:
Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track, by Will Larson @Lethain 
https://t.co/YwlT4173LU

Good perspective-broadening reading material (as was Larson's previous book, An Elegant Puzzle).
