Such a meaty interview with @swyx by @Lethain: https://t.co/aiZSd8Op48

I appreciate the depth, candor, and deliberation about Developer Experience (DX) present throughout this entire piece. Thank you both!

“ yes, if you can afford to, offering an SDK (or a CLI, by the way) generally provides a better developer experience than just the raw API…” #ux

Excited for this interview with @swyx on intersection of developer experience and infrastructure. As you chat with folks working on developer experience, much of what they do with an external focus, good infra teams do internally.

Ties in very nicely with the recent InfraEng writeup on managing efficiency, which is very much influenced by the time I spent working with Smruti!

Have an interview up from @smrutirp, with a particular focus on efficiency e.g. managing infrastructure costs, but wide ranging across goals and metrics, data platform, decision making, and succeeding in complex organizations.
