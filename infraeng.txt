Excited for this interview with @swyx on intersection of developer experience and infrastructure. As you chat with folks working on developer experience, much of what they do with an external focus, good infra teams do internally.

Ties in very nicely with the recent InfraEng writeup on managing efficiency, which is very much influenced by the time I spent working with Smruti!

Have an interview up from @smrutirp, with a particular focus on efficiency e.g. managing infrastructure costs, but wide ranging across goals and metrics, data platform, decision making, and succeeding in complex organizations.
